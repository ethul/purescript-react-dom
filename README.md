Low-level React DOM bindings for PureScript. You may also be interested in the higher-level [`react-basic-dom`](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-react-basic-dom) library.

The library summary hasn't been written yet (contributions are welcome!). The library summary describes the library's purpose in one to three sentences.

## Installation

Install `react-dom` with [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago):

```sh
spago install react-dom
```

You will also need to install the `react-dom` package from NPM:

```sh
npm install --save react-dom
```

## Quick start

The quick start hasn't been written yet (contributions are welcome!). The quick start covers a common, minimal use case for the library, whereas longer examples and tutorials are kept in the [docs directory](./docs).

## Documentation

`react-dom` documentation is stored in a few places:

1. Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-react-dom).
